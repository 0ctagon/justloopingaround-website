                    This is a website created by a fan which lists all the songs created by Marc Rebillet during his streams. This site is not affiliated to Marc Rebillet (although he has seen it and expressed his gratitude on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/g/1ZPpoKxKh7/?mibextid=wwXIfr" class="custom-link">Facebook group Marc Rebillet aka Loop Daddy</a> and on the pinned post on his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/loopdaddy/" class="custom-link">subreddit</a>). The site only lists streams available on Marc Rebillet's official channel, and does not (for the moment) contain songs from other sources.

                    I was wandering around on reddit when I came across a post featuring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLkbqWSY6Bg" class="custom-link">this video</a>. Intrigued by this masterclass, I explored this new YouTube channel a little further. It only took me a few <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-UmoQlqp_0" class="idealogues-0">i</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g5NDLKy0NI" class="idealogues-1">d</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omab6QAwBCA" class="idealogues-2">e</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRpUr5iQPIY" class="idealogues-3">a</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivH_Ft8wqmM" class="idealogues-4">l</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrXQ4OXmQok" class="idealogues-5">o</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtRR_q8Vh_A" class="idealogues-6">g</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBoDWL_bayc" class="idealogues-7">u</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZmtl3l1R9A" class="idealogues-8">e</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeKDDP0Fv0E" class="idealogues-9">s</a> to realise how much I was resonating with what was happening before my eyes and in my ears.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a while, I started listening to his various streams from the time. I became a fan of a few songs, and I added some of them to my Firefox favourites so that I wouldn't lose them and could listen to them again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More and more streams are being released, more and more songs are amazing, I'm starting to memorise the stream names and what minute the songs I like start.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I start to worry: am I missing out on any masterclasses? As I keep listening to the same passages from the streams, I gradually forget the other songs created around these passages. Maybe there are some exceptional songs I missed on the first listen? So I decided to listen to everything again and to write down in an excel spreadsheet some information and a little commentary on each song in each stream (which is now the <a href="./tierlist" class="custom-link">Tierlist</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having an Excel spreadsheet is great, but it's not very practical when it's not at hand. Why not turn it into a site that can be accessed anytime, anywhere? And why not share it with other Marc fans? And why not add a <a href="./#jukebox" class="custom-link">few elements</a> for people who don't know Marc and want to find out? And why not translate it from French into English, as his fanbase is mainly in the US? It was after all these little steps and reflections that this site came into being. It started in 2020 and has been an on-and-off project for <a href="./changelog" class="custom-link">a few years</a>.

                    Web coding is neither my area of expertise nor my passion (although I would admit it's pretty satisfying when things just work). The website should work fine on computer. However, I found out that Twitch embeds are inconsistent across browsers and devices (for example, it works on Safari but not on Firefox on iPhone Mini, and it doesn't work on any browsers on iPhone16...). If you know how to fix some issues you may encounter, feel free to contact me.

                    Thanks to Marc for the streams, and thank you for using this site. It fills me with joy when someone discovers a song thanks to the Jukebox or finds a song they had in their head but didn't know which stream it came from.
